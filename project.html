        <p>
        Beyond the Rift is an action platformer game currently in production for a senior level interactive narrative course.
             It follows the triumphs of a medieval warrior who was born with supernatural powers that exceed his imaginations.
        Looking at past semester examples, our team realized that medieval settings were more common than we had assumed.
        Thus, my goal was to capture the elements in our game that make us unique within a set of
        four illustrations, made over one weekend.

        <p>
        To compose character and environment art that would be representative of Bjorn Ironhand's journey,
        I first gathered insight on what our team had agreed upon previously.
        To accomplish this, I skimmed through our past writeups and noted any mentions regarding setting and mood.
        The key takeaways were:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Several <strong>character deaths</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>mass destruction</strong> of the protagonist's hometown.</li>
            <li>The protagonist's struggle with the <strong>curse</strong> he was born with.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        from these points, I decided that I would opt for colours with low brightness as well as sharp contrasts to convey the dark,
        dramatic mood of our story.
        </p>
        <hr class="margin-small">

        <h4 class="opacity-medium">Ideation</h4>
        <p>I then created rapid sketches of potential compositions for each concept illustrations.
        The main focus during this step was to define where the focal point will be (based on takeaways),
        as well as defining value contrasts that would most efficiently convey the mood of our project.</p>

        <p class="margin-small">
            In Photoshop, I digitized the sketches with the highest contrasts and compositional flow.
            Artboards were used to maintain consistency across all pieces while ensuring that there was little overlap in composition, and I painted primarily
            using the lasso tool as there was only three days to finish all pieces.

        <p class="margin-small">
            Once I felt that the sketches were detailed enough, I imported each piece to Procreate on my iPad, where
            I was able to get a closer look at each piece to add textures as well as finishing touches.

        <p class="margin-small">
            As a result of these pieces, our team now has a unified idea of what each setting in our story looks like.
            Through the process, I learned how crucial it is to invest time in background research and drafting of the final pieces to be able to
            produce impactful concept art within a tight time constraint.
