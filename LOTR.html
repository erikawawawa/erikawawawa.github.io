                Legacy of the Rift is a side-scrolling beat ‘em up platformer game
                developed over the course of a semester for senior level game design course.
                My team and I developed a game featuring three playable characters, original art and story, and
                four possible endings based on player choice.
           This project was <strong>awarded first place by our professor and industry guests</strong> during the
                end-of-semester class showcase.</p>
                <h3>Duration: 13 weeks</h3>
          <h3>Tools: Figma, Photoshop, Unity, Aseprite, Procreate</h3>
            <h3>Team: Mark Robles, Hanna Luu</h3>
            <h3>Roles: Interaction design, interface design, illustration, animation, usability testing</h3>

        <h2 class="center-headers">Interface Design</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
            Our team's first task was to define its target demographic, mechanics, end conditons and its player touchpoints.
            As a result of our discussion, I was able to create an inventory of visual assets needed that would guide me in the design process while the rest of my team branched off to work on the back end of our game.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the beginning of development, our team knew that the biggest selling point
                of our game would be the character-switching, however, because there were few games we could find
                which had a similar system to ours, my greatest challenge was designing an interface that would signify to users
                what characters and abilities were available to them. In addition, there was also a need to define a way to balance this
                UI alongside other elements that were important for goal progression, including player health points & zeal (the game's equivalent to mana points).
            </p>
            <p>
                Below are explorations I made on Figma so that I would be able to receive feedback from my teammates in real time.
                We then used these drafts as a starting point for our user testing process.
                During this process, I also created flowcharts using our UI mockups as a way to unify our team’s vision during development.

</div>
        <h2 class="center-headers">Art & Animation</h2>
        <div>
            <p>On top of designing the UI, I was also developed every visual asset,
                a fraction of which included, 8 character designs, 40+ player and enemy sprite animations, 5 background illustrations,
                a few obstacles, 12 dialogue portraits, a title logo, and special effects. When handing off sprite sheets to my teammates, I ensured that
                I included animated GIFs to communicate how I envisioned the animations to play.

            <p>The biggest challenge during this process was to successfully leverage my time so that I could create a vast number of assets, without compromising my other course
                projects or the quality of the assets. In order to accomplish this, I scheduled a few hours before I slept each night, for almost
                two months, without break, as time to create at least one animated sprite. This method helped me with not only giving myself
                ample time to finish the visual assets, but also in developing a streamlined process that helped me maximize the time I had for animating. </p>

            <h2 class="center-headers">User Testing</h2>

        <div>
            <p>
                At the same time where I was creating our assets, our team conducted over 15 play testing sessions to collect
                feedback and observations regarding our design decisions. My role during this process
                was to organize and host 13 of these sessions; some of the tasks I also completed were defining the key design
                questions to be answered, and analyzing observations and feedback to understand what was missing from our game.
            </p>

            <p class="caption-text"><small>Photo example of a user test setup.</small></p>

            <p>
                During user tests, we took an approach where our team did not provide any verbal instructions unless absolutely necessary,
                to determine the efficiency of the game's UI and tutorial. Additionally, we asked each play tester to “think out loud”, so that we would
                be able to write down their thoughts or complaints in real time. While initially our team assumed that the
                feedback elements we already had were efficient enough, some notable observations we made that subverted our expectations included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users struggling to use character abilities due to a closed-in camera perspective.</li>
                <li>Users not understanding the objective of each level until they received verbal instruction from our team.</li>
                <li>Users mentioning that they did not feel like they could finish the game.</li>
                <li>Users not engaging with dialogue-heavy tutorials, resulting in a lack of understanding of the controls.</li>
            </ul>

            </div>

            <h2 class="center-headers">Refinements</h2>
        <div>

            <p class="margin-small">
                Based on our observations, my team continued to make major changes to our game. Some of these changes included:
            </p>

                    <p class="caption-text"><small>Final UI, after refinements were implemented.</small></p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <ul class="margin-small">
                <li>Creating more space for players to move their characters by scaling down our camera perspective & UI elements.</li>
                <li>Adding a display that tells users how many more enemies they have to defeat, so that players are getting consistent feedback on their progress.</li>
                <li>Reducing the number of “ultimate abilities” from 3 to 1 so the player has less resources to keep track of.</li>
                <li>Addition of a mini-map to prevent players from being blind-sided by enemies.</li>
            </ul>

            </div>
            <h2 class="center-headers">Outcome</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Because there were several tasks to complete at any given point during the semester,
                Legacy of the Rift played a crucial role in fostering my multi-tasking and time-management skills which was what made it
                possible for me to finish the project at all. Knowing that this game was awarded first place amongst the rest of the class,
                which was achieved while managing two other course projects, has made me confident that even under extremely
                demanding conditions I am able to produce exceptional work.</p>
