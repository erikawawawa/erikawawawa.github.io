                A "focus timer" feature for SoundCloud's mobile application, designed and prototyped as
                part of a senior-level interaction design course.

            <h2 class="opacity-medium">1. Research</h2>
            <p class="margin-small">
                To gain an understanding on the ways SoundCloud is used, I conducted interviews over Zoom and Discord with university students ages 20-22 to gain insight on how they use SoundCloud.
                Some key discoveries included: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    People more frequently use spotify or apple music due to them hosting more major artists on the platform
                </li>
                <li>
                    Listeners already have expectations as to what they want to listen to when they open soundcloud
                </li>
                <li>
                    primary uses of soundcloud are to have music to listen to while studying, working out, driving
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="opacity-medium">2. Ideation</h2>
            <p class="margin-small">
                When brainstorming possible features, what was most helpful for me in defining
                a design opportunity was asking interviewees to elaborate on their primary use for SoundCloud.
                Many of them mentioned that while they open SoundClound whenthey intend to be productive,
                they usually leave the app when they get distracted from their music, even if they did not mean to.
                Furthermore, many of them mentioned that they only have one or two playlists that they open SoundCloud for.
                </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I decided to expand on the idea of using playlists by proposing a focus timer feature. This would work so that users are able
                to combine one of their pre-exisitng playlists with a count-down timer so that they are able to minimize
                distractions on their phone for a set amount of time.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h2 class="opacity-medium">3. Prototype</h2>
            <p>After a feature had been proposed, I created three rounds of wireframes in the span of one week, from low fidelity to high.
                Throughout the process, I was able to get casual feedback from my peers as to what parts of the interaction were unclear to them,
                which helped me greatly in identifying which parts of the interactions I should focus on iterating upon given the time constraint.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p>The biggest challenge during this process was to successfully leverage my time so that I could create a vast number of assets, without compromising my other course
                projects or the quality of the assets. In order to accomplish this, I scheduled a few hours before I slept each night, for almost
                two months, without break, as time to create at least one animated sprite. This method helped me with not only giving myself
                ample time to finish the visual assets, but also in developing a streamlined process that helped me maximize the time I had for animating. </p>

            <br>

            <h2 class="opacity-medium">Final Product</h2>

            <p class="margin-small">
                SoundCloud Focus is a focus timer that allows eaasily distracted users to get productive using their pre-exisitng playlists.
                They will be able to plan a session by picking a playlist and setting their timer.
                They can also choose to log additional information such as their activies,
                or be able to revisit a previous session from the menu screen to maximize their productivity.  </p>

<h2>Visit the prototype <a href="https://cloud.protopie.io/p/79397b4f28">here.</a></h2>

            <h3>Plan your session</h3>
            <p class="margin-small">
                Before using the timer, users are asked to set a time and a playlist to use during the session.
                Returning users are able to pick from a previously planned session,
                or view their previous activity to guide them in planning a new one.  </p>

            <h3>Focus</h3>
            <p>
                To eliminate distractions on their phone, the only controls that are available to the user during focus mode is “shuffle”, “repeat”, or “cancel”.
                Users are only able to exit this mode through the exit button or by waiting for the timer to reach 0.
            </p>

            <h3>Track your activity</h3>
            <p>Users are able to view their listening activity at the beginning or end of each session.
                To utilize SoundCloud’s social features.
                They will also be able to share their sessions with their followers. </p> <br>
