                A "focus timer" feature for SoundCloud's mobile application, designed and prototyped as
                part of a senior-level interaction design course.

            <h2 class="center-headers">Background Research</h2>
            <div>
            <p>
                While I knew of long-time SoundCloud users around me, I myself began this project with minimal experience in using the service before.
                <br><br>In order to understand and analyze the ways SoundCloud was used, I conducted interviews over Zoom and Discord with university students ages 20-22 to answer who they were as consumers, as well as why and when they use SoundCloud.
            </p>

            <h2 class="center-headers">User Persona</h2>
            <div>
            <p>
                Many of the interviewees mentioned that while they open SoundCloud when they intend to be productive,
                they <strong>usually leave the app when they get distracted from whatever task they chose to accomplish,</strong> even if they did not mean to.
                Furthermore, many of them mentioned that mainly <strong>open SoundCloud with the intentions of listening to playlists or artists that they already had added to their library.</strong></p>

               <img class="border" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbiwj2oo8/image/upload/v1642579525/Frame_4_hf5lfm.png">
                <p class="caption-text"><small>A user persona based upon issues and goals discovered during interviews.</small></p>

            <h2 class="center-headers">Idea proposal</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Seeing that outside distractions seemed to be the leading obstacle in user retention, I decided a fun way to prevent this issue was by proposing a <strong>focus timer</strong> feature. This would work so that users are able
                to combine one of their pre-existing playlists with a count-down timer so that they are <strong>encouraged to retain their focus for a set amount of time,
                    therefore minimizing their likelihood of leaving the app</strong> due to distractions.
            </p>

            <h2 class="center-headers">Prototype</h2>

            <div>
            <p>After a feature had been proposed, I created three rounds of wireframes in the span of one week, from low fidelity to high.
                Throughout the process, I was able to get casual feedback from my peers as to what parts of the interaction were unclear to them,
                which helped me greatly in identifying which parts of the interactions I should focus on iterating upon given the time constraint.
            </p>

            <h2 class="center-headers">Design System</h2>
            <div>
                <p>One of the biggest challenges during this project was that as an unaffiliated student, I did not have access to SoundCloud's
                style guides. To ensure that this would not result in gaps between my feature's and SoundCloud's design systems, I opted to do an intensive analysis of the of the app in order to fine a reference for every new screen I was to include in my feature.</p>

                <!-- SoundCloud Focus is a focus timer that allows easily distracted users to get productive using their pre-exisitng playlists. -->
                Listeners will be able to plan a session by picking a playlist and setting their timer.
                They can also choose to log additional information such as their activities,
                or be able to revisit a previous session from the menu screen to maximize their productivity.  </p>

            <h3>Plan your session</h3>
                    <img class="cornerradii" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbiwj2oo8/image/upload/v1642150944/Start_AdobeCreativeCloudExpress_jzsime.gif">
            <p class="margin-small">
                Before using the timer, listeners are asked to set a time and a playlist to use during the session.
                Returning users are able to pick from a previously planned session,
                or view their previous activity to guide them in planning a new one.  </p>

            <h3>Focus</h3>

            <p>
                To eliminate distractions on their phone, the only controls that are available to the listener during focus mode is ‚Äúshuffle‚Äù, ‚Äúrepeat‚Äù, or ‚Äúcancel‚Äù.
                Listeners are only able to exit this mode through the exit button or by waiting for the timer to reach 0.
            </p>

            <h3>Track your activity</h3>

            <p>Listeners are able to view their listening activity at the beginning or end of each session.
                To utilize SoundCloud‚Äôs social features,
                they will also be able to share their sessions with their followers. </p> <br>
              </div>
            <h2 class="center-headers">Outcome</h2>
            <div><p>This project was important to me in understanding the process behind designing new products for a pre-existing service.
            From identifying user bases, to integrating my designs with a pre-existing design system, I feel that SoundCloud Focus is an accurate portrayal of my ability to
            become somewhat of a "chameleon" and fully immerse myself with any business within a short period of time.</p>
