  <h3>Wagyu is a set of cow-themed icons that will be printed onto keycaps and be released as "novelties".</h3>

<p>They can be purchased alongside a set of regular mechanical keyboard keycaps. </p>

<h3>Process</h3>

<p>While a previous iteration of these icons existed, the client approached me as he was wanting to take a different approach to the branding  so that it was "cuter" and "less stiff". This is the basis of the art direction I took, while working closely with my client to produce icons that struck a balance between "realistic" and "cute" iconography. </p>

<p>To avoid as much misunderstanding between myself and the client as possible, my first step was to produce as many rough drafts as I could to be able to grasp a visual interpretation of what my client had in mind. During our first contact, we had outlined what kind of icons we wanted to include in the set, as well as that we wanted a "cutesy" approach, which was derived from my client's experience in the mechanical keyboard market. For each icon, I made sure to create a minimum of 3 variations, which ultimately smoothed our process as my client could simply point out which versions were closest to what he had in mind. </p>

<p>After narrowing down which icons would make it to our final selection, I created vector versions of the icons on Adobe Illustrator as this was crucial to ensuring that the drawings followed the constraints that would come with printing using a unique machine dedicated to keycaps.</p>

<p>The result is a set of keycaps that are, while still currently in production, an accurate reflection of the brand image the client had in mind. </p>

<p>While this project came with many constraints, I feel that I ultimately become more flexible as a designer, as it taught me how to create designs that still work even when held back by many rules. </p>
