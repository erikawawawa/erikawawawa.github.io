    <h1>Argon Chalice Redesigned</h1>

    <h3>Argon chalice is a role-playing strategy game developed for a game design course over the span of a month in fall 2020.</h3>
    <p>i was the lead art director for this project, in charge of all visual assets, which ranged from character design, to background art. <br><br>Try the game <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~karsonn/"><strong>here.</strong></a></p>

   <h3> Process</h3>
 <p>The previous iteration of this game came with many faults, such as inconsistency in visual assets, which in turn made the objective of the original argon chalice unclear. My objective was to keep the eerie feeling of the original, while matching the renewed atmosphere of our team's new iteration on the game, where we aimed to reach a younger audience with straightforward gameplay. </p>
    <p>To achieve the balance between eerie and cheerful, I paid close attention to the color scheme of my assets. While choosing bright, playful colours to note important elements, the rest of the game is in grayscale to keep the overall tone the opposite of playful, in respect to the original version. </p>

    <p>Ideation was done on paper and pen, while creation of pixel art was done through iPad application Procreate. Shown here is the character design process, where I primarily focused on giving the enemy characters a bizzare look and feel by not allowing them to have proper faces, completely removing the notion that they are living beings.</p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p> After the semester, Argon Chalice Redesigned was featured in my faculty's Fall 2020 showcase, and also earned a 105% final grade. The opportunity to see through the complete visual design process of a game, from conceptualization to completion, was a invaluable one, and I believe this expreience is transferrable to many fields of design. <br><br>
