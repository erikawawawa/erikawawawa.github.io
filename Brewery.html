        <div>
            <p>
                The Exploration Log was the product of a semester-long project in a senior-level user research methods course.
                With the supervision of Mariner Brewing Company, a craft brewery located in
                Coquitlam, British Columbia, my teammates and I designed the Log as a way to encourage customers to
                explore as much of Mariner's beer offerings as they could while the brewery could obtain feedback
                from beer drinkers at the same time.
            </p>
            <h3>Duration: 3 months</h3>
            <h3>Tools: Figma, Zoom, Miro, Adobe Illustrator, Procreate</h3>
            <h3>Team: Ben Kwok, Bryan To, Catelyn Sue</h3>
            <h3>Roles: User interviews, participatory workshop facilitation, <br>user journey mapping, storyboarding, illustration, slide deck design</h3>

        <h2 class="center-headers">Opportunities</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Mariner Brewing Company is a brewery that is deeply connected to their values of community, quality, and respect, and most importantly, their
                drive to <strong>explore territory unknown</strong>. The business is especially proud of their <strong>exploratory batches,</strong> where every week, they would release
                a new flavour of beer for a limited time, and so our group's earliest goal was to design an
                intervention that would highlight this quality of the business.</p>

                <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbiwj2oo8/image/upload/v1642917760/Who_is_Mariner__zrv904.png">
<p>
            In order to accomplish this, there was a need to figure out who our target demographic would be and also how we could
                support the brewery. Upon conducting ethnographic research, which included Zoom interviews with Mariner's marketing manager,
                an online survey which gained us over 50 responses, and calls with two of the survey respondents.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based upon gathered insights, we noticed that there were a couple of design focuses that
                our team found we could concentrate on: target audience reach, and product marketing.
                We decided it would be most efficient to synthesize these two topics into one design focus -
                <strong>strengthening Mariner Brewing's brand identity and presence</strong>,
                in order to diversify and attract more customers.

            The customers
        </h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                Also based upon survey responses and input from brewery staff, Mariner's customers
                were sorted into three segments - those new to beer, beer enthusiasts, and social beer drinkers
                - and user personas were created to represent each of them. With our personas in mind,
                our team then created journey maps to identify the where we would be best be able to encourage beer drinkers to better get to know
                Mariner's beer offerings. <br><br>
                There are two maps; one to represent the experience in Mariner's
                taproom and the other to represent the Mariner experience at liquor stores. The split up of the two experiences was done
                to reflect the brewery's interest in expanding their operations from outside the taproom to have a stronger presence at liquor stores.

            Workshops
        </h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                With our personas and journey maps, the who and what we should design for were now clear to us, however, there was still a need to
                gather information as to how we could design an intervention that would reflect Mariner's emphasis on exploration.
                To better understand how we could utilize our findings so far to create a design intervention, we conducted participatory workshops via Zoom and Miro.
                Workshop activities included an idea sprint, visual collaging, question & answer, and keyword brainstorming.
                While we were able to reach out to both consumers and brewery staff, due to time constraints, we opted to have some of the
                staff members answer a survey for us instead as some were too busy to workshop for us.

        <div>
            <p>
                Following the workshops, we decided to refine our design focus even further so that it better reflected the
                outcomes of our workshop: while we still largely aimed to strengthen Mariner's brand identity, a more specific focus that
                reflected this goal was for us to <strong>create a way to inform customers about Mariner's extensive beer options.</strong>

        <div>
            <p>
             With our renewed focus, as well as Mariner Brewing's emphasis on community and exploration in mind, we finally designed our design solution:
                the Beer Exploration Log. Each page in the log contains a section for customers to record their thoughts as well as collect rewards for each
                time they collect a new beer.

            <h2 class="center-headers">Scenario</h2>

        <div>
            <p><strong>STEP ONE - DISCOVERY</strong><br><br>Upon entering the taproom, brewery customers will be introduced to the exploration log upon staff suggestion.
            The log is designed to pique customer interest through promises of rewards, such as discounts.</p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbiwj2oo8/image/upload/v1642895352/Mariner_Intro_rdcj8e.png">

            <p><strong>STEP TWO - USAGE</strong><br><br>After the customer enjoys their drink, they will have an opportunity to write any thoughts or feelings they had about it. This can be as simple as giving it a
            rating out of 5. The customer can then present their feedback at the register to receive a sticker for their entry; after enough stickers have been collected,
            the customer will be then able to redeem rewards.</p>
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbiwj2oo8/image/upload/v1642895352/Mariner_Intro-2_rl9cch.png">

            <p><strong>STEP THREE - RETENTION</strong>
                <br><br>The log also aims to serve as a piece of feedback for the customers as after several uses, they would have a personalized list of beers where they can see
                their preferences, allowing them to more confidently order beers from Mariner.</p>

            Reflection
        </h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                The vast amount of information available to back up the rationale for our Exploration Log makes is what makes it a strong,
                sustainable product. With this project being the first time I'd ever worked as a designer with a real-life business, as well as going through an extensive research process
                in order to create a product, it was an eye-opening opportunity where I was able to learn how vital qualitative research is and how much it
                influences the outcome of a project.
