            <h2 class="center-headers">Qualitative interviews</h2>
            <div>
            <p>
                For the majority of our team, the initial design domain that we selected -
                deaf and hard of hearing accessibility - was something we were almost completely unfamiliar with.
                To ensure that we had enough context to understand who we were designing for, our team began
                with interviewing a few individuals who were either deaf, or had a family member who
                identified as deaf. The interview revolved around the following three inquiries, aimed to
                help us dispel any of our unconscious biases as well as identify challenges or opportunity spaces we could design for:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    What tasks were involved in their day-to-day routines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    How they communicate with friends, family, and coworkers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Any difficulties that they experience because of hearing complications.
                </li>
            </ul>
                </div>

            <h2 class="center-headers">Insights
                </h2>
            <div>
            <p>
                What found from these interviews were while that our interviewees outwardly stated that they do not feel that their hearing loss do not cause them any problems our difficulties, their stories alluded to them feeling isolated from their environment due to challenges in communicating at work or at home with friends, family and coworkers who are of hearing. Based on the key insights gathered from our interviews, my team decided to narrow down the focus of
                our project to communication between those who are deaf and hard of hearing and those who are not.

            <h2 class="center-headers">Initial proposal</h2>
            <div>
            <p>Now that our project had a clear focus, our group branched out to propose as many ideas as we could as to how we might
                be able to bridge the gap between the deaf/HoH and those who are hearing.   </p>

<p>Upon revisiting the research insights that my team and I had consolidated from our qualitative interviews, it was made clear that even with varying degrees of hearing loss, all of our interviewees relied heavily on visual cues to communicate with their surroundings, regardless of whether they were hearing or not. This is why I thought a transcription app would be appropriate; however, the issue with a regular transcription app is that it would not be sustainable in the long run as interviewees had mentioned that actions such as writing notes or even typing staggers conversation because they take too long.

                <div>
            <p class="margin-small">
                Keeping this in mind, I began outlining a user flow for a transcription app that would include any possible shortcuts to minimise pauses in conversations. Features to support this goal would include hiding the keyboard for those who do not need the speech-to-text feature, the app automatically starting transcription upon opening, and for those who do require the speech-to-text feature, the ability to save vocabulary that they may use frequently.

                    <h3>Plan your session</h3>
                 Before using the timer, users are asked to set a time and a playlist to use during the session.
                Returning users are able to pick from a previously planned session,
                or view their previous activity to guide them in planning a new one.  </p>

            <h3>Focus</h3>
                    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbiwj2oo8/image/upload/c_scale,h_500,r_20/v1641175439/ezgif.com-gif-maker_h0fzv6.gif">
            <p>
                To eliminate distractions on their phone, the only controls that are available to the user during focus mode is “shuffle”, “repeat”, or “cancel”.
                Users are only able to exit this mode through the exit button or by waiting for the timer to reach 0.
            </p>

                <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
            As mentioned in the beginning, because prior to this project knew next to nothing about hearing loss, everything that our team accomplished during these 8 weeks was completely out of my comfort zone. Along the way, my team and I were fortunate enough to get in touch with a hearing support teacher who provided us with guiding points, especially in our vocabulary - we were taught to not treat deafness and hearing loss as the same, and to never refer to them as disabilities. We were also fortunate that we were able to keep close contact with a peer who is HoH who gave us insights that was not possible to have as a full team of hearing people. Through researching and ideating a design solution for a community that I have so little experience with, I feel that Relay has taught me the importance of recognizing one’s own unconscious biases and immersing themselves in someone else’s perspective.
