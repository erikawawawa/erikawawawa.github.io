                Relay is a transcription app made specifically for those with hearing complications as well as hearing people in their communities. On top of transcribing,
                the app aims to bridge the gap between the two demographics using features such as speech-to-text and audio recording.

            <div>
            <p>
                <strong>At the beginning of this project, the initial design domain that we selected - accessibility for
                    deaf and hard of hearing communities - was something I personally was almost completely unfamiliar with.</strong><br>
                <br>
                To ensure that we had enough context to understand who we were designing for, our team began our project
                by interviewing individuals who were either deaf, or had a family member who
                identified as deaf. The interview revolved around the following three inquiries, aimed to
                help us dispel any of our unconscious biases as well as identify challenges or opportunity spaces we could design for:
            </p>

            <h2 class="center-headers">Insights
                </h2>
            <div>
            <p>
                While that our interviewees for the most part stated that do not feel challenged by their hearing loss, citing that they were "used to it",
                environments where the majority of people are hearing left them feeling isolated due to the people around them often having little to no experience with sign language
                or non-verbal communication (writing, gestures, etc.).

                <br>Based on the key insights gathered from our interviews, my team decided to narrow down the focus of our project to <strong>easing verbal communication between those who are deaf and hard of hearing and those who are not.</strong>

            <h2 class="center-headers">Initial proposal</h2>
            <div>
            <p>After having the opportunity to be able to understand the challenges that come from issues with hearing, our group branched out to propose as many ideas as we could as to how we might
                be able to bridge the gap between the deaf/HoH and those who are hearing.<br><br>
                Upon revisiting the research insights that my team and I had consolidated from our qualitative interviews,
    it was made clear that even with varying degrees of hearing loss, all of our interviewees relied heavily on visual cues to communicate with their surroundings, regardless of whether they were hearing or not.
    This is why I thought perhaps a speech-to-text tool would be appropriate; however, the issue with pre-existing speech-to-text apps was that it would not have been sustainable in the long run as interviewees had mentioned
    that actions such as writing notes or even typing staggers conversation because these features "take too long" to use.</p>

                Keeping this in mind, I began outlining a user flow for a transcription app that would include any possible
                shortcuts to minimise pauses in conversations. This user flow was then used as the base to decide on screens that would need
                to be designed for wireframing.

            <h2>Features</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The high-fidelity wireframes were developed on Figma; afterwards, the wireframes were exported and the final prototype of Relay was developed on ProtoPie.
                <br><br>As previously mentioned, the goal that our team aimed to fulfill with this
                project was to assist with verbal communication. The following features have been designed to fulfill this goal.</p>

            <h3>Transcription, optimized for volleying dialogue</h3>
            <img class="cornerradii" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbiwj2oo8/image/upload/v1642055294/transcribe_AdobeCreativeCloudExpress_d5vhwp.gif">
            <p>Conversations often begin spontaneously, which means Relay may be required spontaneously.
                Speech-to-text detection begins as soon as the app is opened so that as little of the conversation as possible is missed.</p>

            <h3>Recording audio clips</h3>
            <img class="cornerradii" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbiwj2oo8/image/upload/v1642055194/record2_AdobeCreativeCloudExpress_j2eip5.gif">
            <p>Designed for those who wish to revisit audio in a quiet environment, free from auditory distractions. To minimize cases
            of audio being recorded without both parties' consent, the recording screen colour contrasts against the transcription screen. A delay
            before this feature can be used has been implemented to prevent accidental activation.</p>

            <h3>Saving frequently used vocabulary</h3>
            <img class="cornerradii" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbiwj2oo8/image/upload/v1642040607/maketext_AdobeCreativeCloudExpress_2_gtngjr.gif">
            <p>For those who require the speech-to-text feature, but are held back by the fact that typing takes much longer than speaking,
                 they are able to preset shortcuts to dialogue that they may frequently use.</p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
            As mentioned in the beginning, bprior to this project I knew next to nothing about hearing loss, meaning that everything that our team accomplished during these 8 weeks was completely out of my comfort zone. <br>
                <br>Along the way, my team and I were fortunate enough to get in touch with a hearing support teacher who provided us with guiding points, especially in our vocabulary - we were taught to not treat deafness and hearing loss as the same, and to never refer to them as disabilities. We were also fortunate that we were able to keep close contact with a peer who is HoH who gave us insights that was not possible to have as a full team of hearing people.
                <br><br>Through researching and ideating a design solution for a community that I have so little experience with, I feel that Relay has taught me the importance of recognizing oneâ€™s own unconscious biases and immersing themselves in someone elseâ€™s perspective.
