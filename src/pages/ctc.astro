    Canada Post has, for the last 17 years, been seeing a decline in their profits as letter delivery becomes increasingly replaced by the internet, while faster, cheaper competitors such as UPS and FedEx have been growing their shares in the parcel delivery market.
    <br>
    On the other hand, they are in a unique position as a federal Crown corporation to deliver services to all communities across Canada. As underpinned in initiatives such as their introduction of ‘community hub’-style post offices, they are increasing efforts in serving rural areas as part of their solution outside of their existing services in order to establish financial self-sustainability.

  <h2>THE POTENTIAL OF POSTAL WORKERS IN SENIOR CARE
  </h2>

  <p>
    Across the globe, successful examples of senior check-in services delivered by postal workers, including the “Mimamori” program from Japan Post and the “Veiller sur mes parents” program from the French La Poste, already exist.
  </p>
  <p>Additionally, since 2016, the Canadian Union of Postal Workers has been advocating for Canada Post to leverage its unique positioning and network of over (12540 + 28,400) letter carriers to establish a check-in service for seniors.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, the National Institute on Ageing (NIA), a research centre based at Toronto Metropolitan University, also advocates that Canada Post is in a unique position to deliver such a service. Citing a poll conducted by Leger conducted in 2015, they state that letter carriers are amongst the most trusted professions in Canada, with 87% of Canadians saying they trusted their mail carriers.</p>
  <p>Although the proposal was modelled from overseas solutions, there was definitely opportunity within Canada’s seniors as well, with Statistics Canada reporting that 1 in 4 Canadians will be over the age of 65 by 2030 (in comparison to 15.3% in 2013), and the NIA and Canadian Medical Association reporting that 96% of Canadians want to age at home for as long as possible.</p>
  
  <h2>Ideation</h2>
  <h3>PROPERLY SCOPING WHAT A POSTAL WORKER CAN AND CANNOT DO
  </h3>
  <p>It is important to note that initial proposals of Carriers that Care were met with a lot of hesitation from user testers. Having conducted user interviews with seven individuals with ages ranging from 20s to 50s, centering our questions around allowed us to sort concerns into four categories:</p>
  
  
  <h2>Phase 1: Setting up visits</h2>

  <p>
    Audience would familiarize themselves with our service through the landing
    page of the service. Here, we outline a description of the service.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ensuring that loved ones have consented to the service, Canada Post will ask
    for contact information of both the loved one and family. The final step of
    the sign-up process will involve the senior recipient of the service, with
    Canada Post reaching out through a phone call to ensure that seniors will be
    aware of the service. Carriers that Care will not begin until this step is
    completed.
  </p>
  <h2>Phase 2: Postal Worker App</h2>
  <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;">
    <iframe
      src="https://vimeo.com/902242958/4c1c822fc3?share=copy"
      style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"
      frameborder="0"
      allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
      allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>
  <p>
    Postal workers can use this app to quickly send reports and access resources
    they may need during the visits.
  </p>
  <p>
    Steps involved in reporting will include reporting on their well-being,
    reporting on topics of interest, and et cetra.
  </p>
  <p>
    Following the visit, Postal worker will fill out and upload a report on
    observations they made during the visit. Reports will be optimized for
    Postal workers to be able to fill out while on-the-go.
  </p>
  <p>
    Should any unexpected events occur during the visits, we plan equip postal
    workers with an ‘emergency resources’ page on the app. Addtionally, we
    through Canada Post’s exisiting training portal, we expect carriers to be
    able to handle certain events to some degree.
  </p>
  <h2>Phase 3: Post-Visit Updates</h2>
  <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;">
    <iframe
      src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/902436807?h=752ba33798"
      style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"
      frameborder="0"
      allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"
      allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
  <p>
    Family members can stay updated of the visits after they occur through
    notifications sent through text and email.
  </p>
  <p>
    If they wish to get a closer look on the reports, they may choose to view
    reports through the dashboard.
  </p>
  <p>
    From the dashboard, families are able to adjust visitation details, send a
    gift to Rachel to be hand-delivered by the carrier, or add other family
    members to get notified about reports.
  </p>
  <h2>What about Consent and Privacy?</h2>
  <p>During user testing, we encountered four primary concerns:</p>
  <img
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbiwj2oo8/image/upload/v1709585139/Group_47_etzxgi.svg"
  />
  <p>
    A primary issue we need to address is the potential invasiveness of the
    service. To counter this, we have taken various measures across the site to
    ensure families inform their loved ones of the service and gain their
    consent to sign up through callouts, physical information packages and the
    call after the signup.
