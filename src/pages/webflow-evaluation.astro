  <p class="headline">THE PROBLEM</p>
  <h2 class="headline-h2">Layout manipulation is challenging.</h2>

  <p>- We conducted usability studies, where participants were asked to perform 4 tasks: Set up the page, Adjust the type, Adjust the image, and Adjust the button. We decided on these as they are the common procedures for any type of website building and can be executed by both novice and experienced users.</p>
  <p>Our steps:
    Planning (objectives of the study, identify the tasks to be performed, questionnaires)
Participant Recruitment (8 participants)
Pre-Screening Questions (identify the backgrounds of participants)
Task Performance
Post-Test Questions

  <p class="headline">INITIAL FRAMING</p>

  <h2 class="headline-h2">“HMW increase the visibility of the navigation panel so that it can successfully assist layout manipulation?”</h2>

  <p class="headline">SOLUTION</p>

  <h2 class="headline-h2">Creating a 'mini' navigation panel next to mouse pointer
  </h2>
  <p>In this solution, we expand upon the pre-existing element labels and add the navigation functionality to it.
    When users hover over elements, they are able to see all available layers affecting the particular element they see.</p>
