  <p class="headline">OVERVIEW</p>
  <h2 class="headline-h2"></h2>
  <p>
    As a website building platform, WebFlow is primarily targeted toward
    creative professionals, designers, and agencies. The users of Webflow
    typically have goals such as building professional websites, and launching
    online stores or portfolios. They may have varying levels of experience with
    web design, ranging from beginners with little to no coding knowledge to
    experienced designers who prefer a visual interface for faster prototyping
    and production.
  </p>
  <p>
    For a senior design evaluations course, I conducted usability studies along
    with 4 other teammates, where participants were asked to perform 4 tasks:
    Set up the page, Adjust the type, Adjust the image, and Adjust the button.
    We decided on these as they are the common procedures for any type of
    website building and can be executed by both novice and experienced users.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our steps: Planning (objectives of the study, identify the tasks to be
    performed, questionnaires) Participant Recruitment (8 participants)
    Pre-Screening Questions (identify the backgrounds of participants) Task
    Performance Post-Test Questions
  </p>

  <p class="headline">DEMOGRAPHICS</p>
  <h2 class="headline-h2">We tested on 8 users.</h2>
  <p>5/8 of our participants had experience with website builders.</p>
  <p>3/8 of our participants had coding experience.</p>
  <p>4/8 of our participants had built a website before.</p>

  <p class="headline">THE PROBLEM</p>
  <h2 class="headline-h2">Layout manipulation is challenging.</h2>
  <p>
    Between our user testing participants, we had them perform four tasks that
    pertained the Webflow's core function of getting users to set up a new site
    and adding elements: <br /><br />
    1. Set up the page,<br />
    2. Adjust the type, <br />
    3. Adjust the image, <br />
    4. Adjust the button.
  </p>
  <p>
    In particular, I was focused on a problem pertaining to #3: Adjusting images.
    <br/><br/>
    When instructed to move an image from left to right, users would attempt to drag-and-drop.
    However, most users would struggle to place the image in the desired spot, as demonstrated below.
  </p>
  <p>(image)</p>
  <p>
    6/8 of our participants were affected by this issue regardless of skill
    level and experience. Resolution of this issue was divided between either
    failure to complete the task, or recovery by discovering a way to move the
    image that was not drag and drop. As this issue results in possible task
    failure even for intermediate-level users, we believe this should be
    assigned a high severity level.
  </p>
  <img src="/image.png" style="width: 50%;">
  <p>3 interviewees answered that this task was impossible to complete. Overall, a majority of people felt like moving images was a somewhat challenging task.</p>

  <p class="headline">INITIAL FRAMING</p>

  <h2 class="headline-h2">
    “HMW increase the visibility of the navigation panel so that it can
    successfully assist layout manipulation?”

  <p class="headline">SOLUTION</p>

  <h2 class="headline-h2">
    Creating a 'mini' navigation panel next to mouse pointer
  </h2>
  <p>
    In this solution, we expand upon the pre-existing element labels and add the
    navigation functionality to it. When users hover over elements, they are
    able to see all available layers affecting the particular element they see.
