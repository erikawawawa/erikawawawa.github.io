    A "focus timer" feature for SoundCloud's mobile application.
  </h2>
  <p>
     Primarily targted towards folks in their early
    20's, the core components of this feature include timer setting, playlist
    selection, and playlist sharing.

  <h2>User Interviews & Discovery</h2>
  <p>
    In order to understand and analyze the ways SoundCloud was used, I conducted
    interviews over Zoom and Discord with target demographics to discover key
    information I was looking for.

    <small>A summary of key insights from interviews.</small>
  </p>
  <p>
    A primary use case amongst
    interviewees included listening to <strong>instrumental soundtracks</strong>
    while they conducted their day-to-day tasks such as studying or doing their chores.
    Their issue with this was that while they open SoundCloud when they intend to
    be productive, they may
    <strong
      >unintentionally leave the app when they get distracted from their task.</strong
    >, at which point the music stops playing. This lead to my problem
    statement:
  </p>

    <h3 class="callout">
      How might we minimize the chances of users <strong>unintentionally stopping their
      music?</strong>

    <h2>Pitch</h2>
    <p>
      Seeing that outside distractions seemed to be the leading obstacle in user
      retention, I decided a fun way to prevent this issue was by proposing a <strong
        >focus timer</strong
      > feature. This would work so that users are able to combine one of their pre-existing
      playlists with a count-down timer so that they are
      <strong
        >encouraged to retain their focus for a set amount of time, therefore
        minimizing their likelihood of leaving the app</strong
      > due to distractions.

    <h2>Prototype</h2>
    <p>
      I created three rounds of wireframes for the focus timer in the span of
      one week, from low fidelity to high. Throughout the process, I was able to
      get feedback from my peers as to what parts of the interaction were
      unclear to them, which helped in identifying interactions I should focus
      on iterating upon.

    <h2>Side note: Dissecting the design system</h2>
    <p>
      To ensure that there would not be in gaps between SoundCloud's design
      systems and my prototype, almost every component incorporated was traced
      directly from the exisitng SoundCloud app. Below are a few examples:
    </p>

    <h2>Solution: Focus mode</h2>

    <p>
      Listeners will be able to plan a session by picking a playlist and setting
      their timer. They can also choose to log additional information such as
      their activities, or be able to revisit a previous session from the menu
      screen to maximize their productivity.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />

  <!-- <h3>Plan your session</h3> -->
  <div class="grid-twocolumn-right-heavy">
    <img
    class="screen3"

      style="margin-left: 8%; width: auto; border-radius: 30px;"
      src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbiwj2oo8/image/upload/v1642150944/Start_AdobeCreativeCloudExpress_jzsime.gif"
    />
    <p>
      Before using the timer, listeners are asked to set a time and a playlist
      to use during the session. Returning users are able to pick from a
      previously planned session, or view their previous activity to guide them
      in planning a new one.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />

  <!-- <h3>Focus</h3> -->
  <div class="grid-twocolumn-right-heavy">
    <img
    class="screen3"

      style="margin-left: 8%; width: auto; border-radius: 30px;"
      src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbiwj2oo8/image/upload/v1642150946/time_AdobeCreativeCloudExpress_uluo3g.gif"
    />
    <p>
      To eliminate distractions on their phone, the only controls that are
      available to the listener during focus mode is “shuffle”, “repeat”, or
      “cancel”. Listeners are only able to exit this mode through the exit
      button or by waiting for the timer to reach 0.
    </p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div class="grid-twocolumn-right-heavy">
    <!-- <h3>Track your activity</h3> -->
    <img
    class="screen3"
      style="margin-left: 8%; width: auto; border-radius: 30px;"
      src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbiwj2oo8/image/upload/v1642150952/end_AdobeCreativeCloudExpress_sqewvf.gif"
    />
    <p>
      Listeners are able to view their listening activity at the beginning or
      end of each session. To utilize SoundCloud's social features, they will
      also be able to share their sessions with their followers.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      This project was important to me in understanding the process behind
      designing new features for a pre-existing service. From identifying user
      bases, to integrating my designs with a pre-existing design system, I feel
      that SoundCloud Focus is an accurate portrayal of my ability to immerse
      myself with any business within a short period of time.
