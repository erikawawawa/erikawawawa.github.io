    <!-- <h2>Introduction</h2> -->
    <h2>
      Fuori Salone, unofficially hosted during Milan Design Week, is an annual
      design festival held in Milan that celebrates and showcases design
      throughout the city.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      The Fuori Salone microsite aims to excite potential event-goers by
      allowing them to preview exhibits through a 'choose-your-own-adventure'
      approach. With participants coming from across the globe, we wanted to
      highlight the wonders of exploration that Fuori Salone brings to Milan.

      <h3>It's <i>your</i> adventure</h3>

      <p>
        Because the Fuori Salone hosts an astronomical number of events, our
        challenge was in scoping the amount of content that we would host in the
        microsite. Rather than putting the focus on events, we opted for an
        approach that focuses on the districts, through tools such as quizzes,
        layouts, and custom-created content.

    <h2>Entry Point</h2>
    <p>
      Upon entering the site, users are given a brief introduction to the site
      then prompted to complete a quiz.

    <h2>Quiz</h2>
    <p>
      The quiz connects each district to their respective themes, while
      personalizing the site experience to the audience. Results of the quiz
      inform the navigational order of the site.

    <h2>Synthesizing the themes</h2>
    <p>
      Each page in the site is structured to show a summary of the theme,
      referenced from their respective press releases, as well as a list of
      exhibits, referenced from various sources, including fuorisalone.it.
      Followed by the statement is a brief description of the district and its
      relationship to design, meant to give the audience context before they
      visit the districts in-person.
