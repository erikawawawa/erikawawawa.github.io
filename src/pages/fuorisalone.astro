    <!-- <h2>Introduction</h2> -->
    <h2>
      Fuori Salone, unofficially hosted during Milan Design Week, is an annual
      design festival held in Milan that celebrates and showcases design
      throughout the city.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      The Fuori Salone microsite aims to excite potential event-goers by
      allowing them to preview exhibits through a 'choose-your-own-adventure'
      approach. With participants coming from across the globe, we wanted to
      highlight the wonders of exploration that Fuori Salone brings to Milan.

      <h3>It's <i>your</i> adventure</h3>

      <p>
        Because the Fuori Salone hosts an astronomical number of events, our
        challenge was in scoping the amount of content that we would host in the
        microsite. Rather than putting the focus on events, we opted for an
        approach that focuses on the districts, through tools such as quizzes,
        layouts, and custom-created content.
      </p>
      <!-- <p>
        (Insert user persona here - a designer seeking to attend Milan Design
        Week, but knows little about the actual event. We want them to be able
        to resonate with the topics presented by each district - smth smth their
        unique identity smth smth everyone has different trips)
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, we expect that the general flow of the website will be as
        follows:
        <br />1. User is introduced to the site.
        <br /> 2. Before introduction to website content, we ask the user to stop
        & reflect on topics in design that resonate with them.
        <br /> 3. Once the topics are selected, the districts of Milan will be presented
        to them in order of the topics selected during their quiz.
        <br /> - Brand aspects: Freedom, adventure, reflection, messages to future
        generations
      </p>
      <p>
        (Other things that could be included: Imagery rationale - what images
        did we collect and why, content - where did we draw these themes from -
        culture studies, personalities of each district)

    <h2>Website</h2>
    <h3>Entry point</h3>
    <p>
      Upon entering the site, users are given a brief introduction to the site
      then prompted to complete a quiz.

  <div class="grid-twocol">
    <h3>Quiz</h3>
    <p>
      The quiz connects each district to their respective themes, while
      personalizing the site experience to the audience. Results of the quiz
      inform the navigational order of the site.

  <div class="grid-twocol">
    <h3>Synthesizing the themes</h3>
    <p>
      Each page in the site is structured to show a summary of the theme,
      referenced from their respective press releases, as well as a list of
      exhibits, referenced from various sources, including fuorisalone.it.
      Followed by the statement is a brief description of the district and its
      relationship to design, meant to give the audience context before they
      visit the districts in-person.
