  <h1>Hi, I'm Erika</h1>
  <h2>A design student at Simon Fraser University, based in Vancouver.</h2>

  <p>
    To me, design is a way to learn about myself through learning about the
    world around us - I love learning about new domains and having the ability
    to apply that knowledge through design to understand different communities.
    <br />
    <br />

    Previously, I was at Excelar Technologies, working closely with
    anesthesiologists and other medical specialists. My other non-design
    experiences include helping out as a Japanese to English language
    interpreter; working closely with Japanese voice acting professionals and
    speaking on their behalf at panels at Anime Revolution, and event that would
    gather over 30,000 attendees.
    <br />
    <br />

    On an average day, you'll be able to find me going on walks or playing video
    games. Sometimes, I'll do both by playing Pokemon GO. :)

          - Previously at Excelar, working on CCPC project 
          - Idk also am a Japanese-English language interpreter at Anirevo
          - I also read and draw and I love gaming on old handheld consoles

          - My approach to design is to read as much as I can (95% reading 5% designing)
          - I love learning about new domains and applying that knowledge to understand different communities
          - Design is a way to learn about myself and my place by learning about the world we live in.

  <!-- <p> I believe that good design follows a well-defined objective. As a
          designer, my principle is to embrace ambiguity by defining the unknown
          and turning them into tangible actions. In every corner of my life, I am
          constantly seeking for inspiration that could ultimately contribute to
          informed, dynamic design solutions.

          sometimes I'll do both by playing Pokemon Go. :)</p> -->
