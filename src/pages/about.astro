      <p>
        I’m a designer with one year of experience in UX and UI at Excelar
        Technologies, where I was designing experiences for clinicians in the
        lower mainland.
        <br /><br />
        My love for design is driven by my passion for good research that dives deep
        into a user’s needs. I seek to apply novel strategies in my work, by employing
        interactions and design techniques that I’ve learned through engaging with
        many shapes and forms of media.

        <br /><br />
        Outside of design, I have almost six years of experience as a Japanese-English
        language interpreter for local pop culture events. I’ve also maintained a
        blog about water for a few months before, alongside being an avid video gamer
        (currently trying & failing to beat Elden Ring’s DLC).
