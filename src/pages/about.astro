    ABOUT ERIKA
  </h4>

  <h2 style="margin: 2% 0 4%; padding: 0;">
    Born and raised in Vancouver. Currently a senior design student at Simon
    Fraser University’s School of Interactive Arts and Technology.

  <p>
    I have one year of experience as a UX/UI designer at Excelar, designing
    experiences for clinicians for hospitals across the province. My non-design
    experience includes six years of Japanese-to-English language interpretation
    across events in Vancouver and Toronto.
    <br />
    <br />

    Design to me belongs in a place where different perspectives and cultures
    are brought together, and is an act meant to create new and inspirational
    stories.
    <!-- The joy in design to me stems from intersecting 
    between parties whose lives should have intersected a long time ago. -->
    <br />
    <br />

    I’m actively seeking opportunities for full-time product or UX design roles.
    Please feel free to reach out!

          - Previously at Excelar, working on CCPC project 
          - Idk also am a Japanese-English language interpreter at Anirevo
          - I also read and draw and I love gaming on old handheld consoles

          - My approach to design is to read as much as I can (95% reading 5% designing)
          - I love learning about new domains and applying that knowledge to understand different communities
          - Design is a way to learn about myself and my place by learning about the world we live in. 
        </p> -->
  <!-- <p> I believe that good design follows a well-defined objective. As a
          designer, my principle is to embrace ambiguity by defining the unknown
          and turning them into tangible actions. In every corner of my life, I am
          constantly seeking for inspiration that could ultimately contribute to
          informed, dynamic design solutions.

  <!-- <p>
           Aside from design, I like to go on walks or play video games -
          sometimes I'll do both by playing Pokemon Go. :)</p> -->
