      <h1>About</h1>
      <h2>
        I'm Erika, a design student at Simon Fraser University, based in
        Vancouver.</h2>
        <p>
          Previously, I was at Excelar Technologies, working closely with anesthesiologists and other medical specialists.
          My other non-design experiences include helping out as a Japanese to English language interpreter; working closely with Japanese
          voice acting professionals and speaking on their behalf at panels at Anime Revolution, and event that would gather over 30,000 attendees.
        <br>
          To me, design is a way to learn about myself through learning about the world around us - I love learning about new domains and having the ability to apply that knowledge through design to understand different communities. 
        <br>
        On an average day, you'll be able to find me going on walks or playing video games. Sometimes, I'll do both by playing Pokemon GO. :)
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          - Previously at Excelar, working on CCPC project 
          - Idk also am a Japanese-English language interpreter at Anirevo
          - I also read and draw and I love gaming on old handheld consoles

          - My approach to design is to read as much as I can (95% reading 5% designing)
          - I love learning about new domains and applying that knowledge to understand different communities
          - Design is a way to learn about myself and my place by learning about the world we live in. 
        </p> -->
        <!-- <p> I believe that good design follows a well-defined objective. As a
          designer, my principle is to embrace ambiguity by defining the unknown
          and turning them into tangible actions. In every corner of my life, I am
          constantly seeking for inspiration that could ultimately contribute to
          informed, dynamic design solutions.
          <br /><br /> -->

           Aside from design, I like to go on walks or play video games -
          sometimes I'll do both by playing Pokemon Go. :)</p> -->
