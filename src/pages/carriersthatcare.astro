      <h3>The financial state of Canada Post</h3>
  
      <p>
        Canada Post has, for the last 17 years, been seeing a decline in their
        profits as letter delivery becomes replaced by the
        internet, while faster, cheaper competitors such as UPS and FedEx have
        been growing their shares in the parcel delivery market.
        <br /><br />
        On the other hand, they are in a unique position as a federal Crown corporation
        to deliver services to all communities across Canada. As underpinned in initiatives
        such as their introduction of ‚Äòcommunity hub‚Äô-style post offices, they are
        increasing efforts in serving rural areas as part of their solution outside
        of their existing services in order to establish financial self-sustainability.

      <h3>The potential of postal workers as part of senior care</h3>

      
      <p>
        Across the globe, postal companies have successfully demonstrated success 
        in expanding their businesses, notably through senior check-in services
        delivered by letter carriers. Examples include the ‚ÄúMimamori‚Äù program from Japan
        Post, and ‚ÄúVeiller sur mes parents‚Äù program from the French La Poste. 
        <br /><br />
        But how does this evidence that such a service would benefit Canada Post? Through investigating
        potential stakeholders - postal workers, and those in senior care - we discovered the following insights:
      </p>

      <h3><i>87% of Canadians trust their mail carriers.</i></h3>
      <p>
        Through a special report released in 2023, our team discovered that the
         National Institute on Ageing (NIA), a research centre based
        at Toronto Metropolitan University, advocates that Canada Post is in
        a unique position to deliver such a service. Citing a poll conducted by Leger
        conducted in 2015, they state that letter carriers are amongst the most trusted
        professions in Canada, with 87% of Canadians saying they trusted their mail
        carriers.
      </p>

      <h3><i>Canadians are getting older.</i></h3>
        <p>Furthermore, within the Canadian context, Statistics Canada has
        reported that 1 in 4 Canadians will be over the age
        of 65 by 2030 (in comparison to 15.3% in 2013), and the NIA and Canadian
        Medical Association reporting that 96% of Canadians want to age at home
        for as long as possible.</p>

      <h3><i>Postal worker unions have been advocating for such a service.</i></h3>
        <p>
        It was also promising that we were able to discover interest for this service amongst employees of Canada Post as well - 
         a report written in 2016, with several follow-ups since (the latest one written in 2023), evidenced to us 
         that the Canadian Union of Postal Workers has been continuously advocating
          for Canada Post to leverage its unique positioning and network of over (12540
          + 28,400) letter carriers to establish a check-in service for seniors for several years now.
        </p>
        <p></p>        However, in order for Canada Post to properly adopt a senior-oriented check-in service, 
        there were areas of consideration that would have to be designed to. Upon presenting our idea in-class, 
        we were met with a few concerns from peers that helped narrowed down these concerns: 
        How would they prevent this service from interfering with what's currently available to Canadians?
        How would the service be modelled so that it would avoid invasiveness? 
        What sort of unique needs and wants would we need to address in re-creating a foreign service for a Canadian demographic?
        <br/><br/>

    <div>
      <h3>Properly scoping what a postal worker can or cannot do</h3>
     
      <p>
        With the goal of identifying underlying gaps in a Canada Post-based senior check-in service,
        as a first step 
        my team and I created a website mockup introducing our service, which we 
        named Carriers that Care (CtC), to user-test with our target demographic: adults who have an
        elderly loved one who lives alone. 
        <br><br>
        Initial proposals of Carriers that Care
        were met with a lot of hesitation from user testers. Having conducted
        user interviews with seven individuals with ages ranging from 20s to
        50s, centering our questions around allowed us to sort concerns into
        four categories:
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
      <img
        style="border-style: none; width: 80%;"
        src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbiwj2oo8/image/upload/v1709585139/Group_47_etzxgi.svg"
      />
      <div class="grid-twocol">
        <div></div>
      <p>
        Across all seven interviewees, the tangible aspects of Carriers That
        Care was universally agreed with to be valuable. However, there was
        concern over the concept of relying on letter carriers to report on
        senior wellbeing - the idea of 'caring for seniors' is accompanied by
        nuanced implications of medical care and invasion of privacy, which
        would put seniors in a vulnerable position as letter carriers would be
        granted a position of authority without going through the proper
        training.
<br>
        Given our results, there was a need to properly define the domains in
        which a letter carrier would support within Carrier that Care. In order
        to accomplish this, we evaluated a framework by the NIA that defines
        four essential pillars that are crucial to supporting ageing comfortably
        at home.
      </p>
    </div>
      <div>
        <img
          style="border-style: none; width: 80%;"

        />
      </div>
      <div class="grid-twocol">
        <div></div>
      <p>
        Amongst the four pillars, we scoped our service and moved forwards with
        an focus on designing around improving social connections to reduce
        loneliness and social isolation, a domain that postal workers can
        reasonably intervene with without reducing the credibility or trust in
        Carriers That Care.

        Following the visit, Postal worker will fill out and upload a report on

        Postal workers to be able to fill out while on-the-go.

    call after the signup.

    Another issue we encountered was a general ovrall confusion on the difference between Carriers that Care and

    which also addes a touch of approachability to the overall tone compared to Canada Post's current branding. As a fun fact, illustrations were hand-drawn by me!
