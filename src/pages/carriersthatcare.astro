    A check-in service to strengthen connections between independently living

    <!-- <h2>Overview</h2> -->
    <h2>
      The Canadian Union of Postal Workers has been advocating for Canada Post
      to offer a senior check-in service since 2016.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      Carriers that care is a proposal for such a door-to-door service to be
      delivered by mail carriers of Canada Post. While primarily aimed at
      seniors in rural Canada who live alone, the service extends to loved ones
      of the seniors, who may be unable to visit on a regular basis.
    </h2>

    <hr />
    <h3>Final Deliverables</h3>
    <p>
      - Concept/Strategy/Framework for a check-in service for Canadian seniors,
      delivered by Canada Post letter carriers.<br />
      - App for postal workers to send information to families and seniors (Stakeholders?)<br
      />
      - Web portal for customers to receive information from the service.<br />
      - Web pages, e-mails and other collateral to explain the service to potential
      and existing customers.<br />
      - Other miscellaneous touchpoints, ie. sign-up process, brochures.
    </p>
    <h3>My contributions</h3>
    <p>
      As part of a group of 5 designers, my focus for this project was on
      contextual research, user flow creation, wireframing, and content design.

  <h2>The Opportunity</h2>
  <p>
    As letter delivery becomes replaced by the internet, postal services around
    the world have been offering new services in order to expand the definiton
    of 'postal work'. The 'Delivering Community Power' initiative by the
    Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) are a set of proposals inspired by a
    sense of need for Canada Post to innovate - one of which include a proposal
    for a senior check-in service.

        Canada Post has, for the last 17 years, been seeing a decline in their
        profits as letter delivery becomes replaced by the internet, while
        faster, cheaper competitors such as UPS and FedEx have been growing
        their shares in the parcel delivery market.

          On the other hand, they are in a unique position as a federal Crown
          corporation to deliver services to all communities across Canada. As
          underpinned in initiatives such as their introduction of 'community
          hub'-style post offices, they are increasing efforts in serving rural
          areas as part of their solution outside of their existing services in
          order to establish financial self-sustainability.

        How might we support socially isolated seniors through the existing
        Canada Post infrastructure?
      </h3> -->

      <h3>An emerging need for senior support infrastructure</h3>
      <p>
        Through investigating reports released by the National Insititue of
        Aging, my team and myself discovered that 40% of Canadians aged 55+
        reported experiencing a lack of companionship and regular social
        connections with other people, while 67% of Canadians reported believing
        that a lack of social connection negatively impact their overall health
        and wellbeing.
      </p>
      <p>
        A comparative analysis on postal services in other parts of the world
        was conducted by myself and my team. We discovered that offices such as
        La Poste in France and Japan Post are already existing utlizing their
        infrastructure of door-to-door delivery to provide care to seniors who
        are separated from their families via periodical check-ins.
      </p>
      <p>
        With over 26,500 letter carriers employed by Canada Post, my team and I
        believe that there is a reasonable space for the business to intervene
        with the senior care space.

    <h2>Scoping - Are postal workers qualified for this?</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        The core requirements of Carriers that Care are primarily designed
        around secondary research sourced from reports released by the <a
          href="https://www.niageing.ca/">National Institute of Ageing (NIA)</a
        >, a think tank operating out of Toronto Metropolitan University.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, the scope of the service is based around their “Ageing in
        the Right Place” report, where they define four fundamental pillars that
        are essential in enabling older adults to age in the most appropriate
        setting where their personal preferences, circumstances, and care needs
        are met:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Promoting Preventive Health and Better Chronic Disease Management <br
        />
        2. Strengthening Home and CommunityBased Care and Supports for Unpaid Caregivers
        <br /> 3. Developing More Accessible and Safer Living Environments <br
        />4. Improving Social Connections to Reduce Loneliness and Social
        Isolation
      </p>
      <p>
        Carriers that Care is made with a particular focus on the fourth pillar
        - improving social connections to reduce loneliness & social isolation.

      This decision was made from my team and I's awareness that the idea of
      'caring for seniors' is accompanied by nuanced implications of medical
      care and invasion of privacy. We agree with this notion, and the idea that
      a service like Carriers That Care could unfairly put letter carriers in a
      position of authority without the proper training for it, thus putting
      seniors in a vulnerable position.
    </p>
  </div> -->

  <div class="grid-twocol">
    <div></div>
    <p>
      During user testing and in-class presentations, proposals for Carriers
      that Care were met with concerns around putting postal workers in a
      position where they would have authority in areas that they would not be
      adequately trained for, one example of such including medical care. By
      employing this framework, and committing our focus to the area of social
      connections, my team and myself wanted to ensure that we properly
      establish that we are designing around a domain within senior support that
      postal workers can reasonably intervene with - without reducing
      credibility or trust in Carriers that Care.

      <h3>Defining the service</h3>
      <p>
        A web portal, accessible from Canada Post's pre-existing website, would
        describe the details of Carriers That Care, allowing for a shared
        understanding of the service between families and seniors. To ensure
        that contents of this website are also available offline, we have
        designed a brochure to be mailed to indicate from one party to the other
        their interest in the service.

        The sign-up process places emphasis on ensuring that the senior, who

        is consenting to receiving the service. Anticipating cases where
        families will be signing up on the senior's behalf, we have included
        callouts throughout the process, and will not begin delivery of the
        service until Canada Post receives vocal consent from the recipient.
