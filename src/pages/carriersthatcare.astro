    <h2>
      Carriers that care is a proposal for such a door-to-door service to be
      delivered by mail carriers of Canada Post. While primarily aimed at
      seniors in rural Canada who live alone, the service extends to loved ones
      of the seniors, who may be unable to visit on a regular basis.

        How might we support socially isolated seniors through the existing
        Canada Post infrastructure?
      </h3> -->

      <h3>There's an emerging need for senior support infrastructure</h3>
      <p>
        Through investigating reports released by the National Insititue of
        Aging, my team and myself discovered that 40% of Canadians aged 55+
        reported experiencing a lack of companionship and regular social
        connections with other people, while 67% of Canadians reported believing
        that a lack of social connection negatively impact their overall health
        and wellbeing.
      </p>
      <p>
        A comparative analysis on postal services in other parts of the world
        was conducted by myself and my team. We discovered that offices such as
        La Poste in France and Japan Post are already existing utlizing their
        infrastructure of door-to-door delivery to provide care to seniors who
        are separated from their families via periodical check-ins.
      </p>
      <p>
        With over 26,500 letter carriers employed by Canada Post, my team and I
        believe that there is a reasonable space for the business to intervene
        with the senior care space.

        The core requirements of Carriers that Care are primarily designed
        around secondary research sourced from reports released by the <a

        In particular, the scope of the service is based around their “Ageing in
        the Right Place” report, where they define four fundamental pillars that
        are essential in enabling older adults to age in the most appropriate
        setting where their personal preferences, circumstances, and care needs
        are met:

      This decision was made from my team and I's awareness that the idea of
      'caring for seniors' is accompanied by nuanced implications of medical
      care and invasion of privacy. We agree with this notion, and the idea that
      a service like Carriers That Care could unfairly put letter carriers in a
      position of authority without the proper training for it, thus putting
      seniors in a vulnerable position.
    </p>

  <div class="grid-twocol">
    <div></div>
    <p>
      During user testing and in-class presentations, proposals for Carriers
      that Care were met with concerns around putting postal workers in a
      position where they would have authority in areas that they would not be
      adequately trained for, one example of such including medical care. By
      employing this framework, and committing our focus to the area of social
      connections, my team and myself wanted to ensure that we properly
      establish that we are designing around a domain within senior support that
      postal workers can reasonably intervene with - without reducing
      credibility or trust in Carriers that Care.

  <p>The general user journey of Carriers that Care is as follows.</p>

  <img src="/General - user flow.png" />
<br><br>
  <p>
    Furthermore, the defined touchpoints imagine the involvement of three
    potential users. Each persona represents the possible actors in a single
    user flow.</p>

    <div class="grid-threecol">

    In general, we imagine that a user's first interaction with Carriers That
    Care will be a three-step process, eventually simplifying into two steps as
    they get used to the routine of postal worker check-ins. The interfaces that
    were designed aim to encapsulate the digital touchpoints that would be
    involved in the service, on both the customer side and the employee side.

        information with the loved ones that they do not live with. A web
        portal, accessible from Canada Post's pre-existing website, would be
        available in conjunction with a mailable brochure, for family members
        who wish to indicate to loved ones without requiring them to access the

      This sign-up process places emphasis on ensuring that the senior, who will
      be the recipient of the service, is aware of Carriers that Care and is
      consenting to receiving the service. Anticipating cases where families
      will be signing up on the senior's behalf, we have included callouts
      throughout the process, and will not begin delivery of the service until
      Canada Post receives vocal consent from the recipient.

    <p>
      In order to provide the postal workers with some guidance during
      check-ins, we want to equip them with an app that would provide them with
      tools. A features map would be as follows:
    </p>

    <!-- <video

    ></video> -->
    <div>
      <h3>Filling out & Sending reports</h3>
      <p>
        This would be the core feature of the carrier-side app. To best
        accommodate postal workers who are constantly on the go, the report has
        been made to be as short-handed as possible: interactions will be
        primarily through button inputs, and text input prompts will be kept to
        a bare minimum of one field.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Side note: Framing of questions - what are letter carriers reporting on?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Most letter carriers will not have undergone the necessary training to
        be able to make observations pertaining to medical conditions. Thus
        interpretations pertaining mood, appetite, and other lifestyle choices
        can be largely subjective and fluctuating based on letter carrier.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we do not wish to place expectations on letter carriers without
        proper training to be able to correctly interpret the health conditions
        of older adults, the questions they would be required to answer are
        framed so they would be centred around objective observations, which
        allow the families and recipients to interpret the observations based on
        their knowledge.
      </p>
      <h3>Resources for unexpected events & emergencies</h3>
      <p>
        To alleviate the pressure on postal carriers to be experts on handling
        risks that are outside of their expertise, would allow them to maintain
        their focus on this service's core strategy, on preventing social
        isolation. The 'resources' tab will act as a manual to answer questions
        such as 'what do I do if the recipient is not answering the door'; the
        'report an emergency' tab will connect the letter carrier to the
        appropriate emergency service, such as the police or the ambulance.

      <h3>Delivery of reports</h3>
      <p>
        Each time a report is sent out by the letter carrier, both the recipient
        of the service and registered loved ones will be able to view them
        through their preferred medium or text or e-mail. This will be a preview
        edition, containing a brief description from the carrier of how the
        visitation went.

        Full reports will be available to view through a Carriers That Care

    <p>
      At any point in the service, the customer may feel the need to adjust
      their visitation plans, collect more information about their assigned
      letter carrier, or perhaps want to submit feedback to the service. In
      general, we felt that a dashboard was necessary to ensure that customers

>2023 financial reports</a>, Canada Post has revealed that letter delivery
    has been on the decline since 2005. In the parcel delivery space, they have been losing market share
    to faster, cheaper competitors such as FedEx or UPS. As a response, the crown
    corporation seeks to extend its offerings beyond traditional postage services.

  <h3>2. Keeping up with the world</h3>
  <p>
    We find that this is a global trend shared with postal services in other
    countries.

    has identified at least five other countries, including not only Japan and France,
    but even the United States, which offer successful check-in services, some of
    which are even more extensive than our proposed Carriers That Care.

  <h3>3. Integration with other parts of the business</h3>
  <p>
    While we acknowledge that implementation of this service alone would not
    resolve Canada Post’s declining revenues, my team and I still believe that
    it would benefit the business in the way of opening new avenues for income.
    In Jersey, their check-in service is funded by their Department of Health
    and Community Services. Furthermore, in cases such as with the U.K’s Royal
    Mail Health, where customers may connect to a pharmacist or GP and have
    prescriptions delivered to their door, expansion of services has allowed for
    partnerships with large-scale pharmaceutical companies. Partnerships with
    government and other corporations are just a few ways that Canada Post could
    leverage Carriers That Care as a revenue source.
