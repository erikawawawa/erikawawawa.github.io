      <p>
        Canada Post has, for the last 17 years, been seeing a decline in their
        profits as letter delivery becomes replaced by the internet, while
        faster, cheaper competitors such as UPS and FedEx have been growing
        their shares in the parcel delivery market.
        <br />
        <p>
          On the other hand, they are in a unique position as a federal Crown
          corporation to deliver services to all communities across Canada. As
          underpinned in initiatives such as their introduction of 'community
          hub'-style post offices, they are increasing efforts in serving rural
          areas as part of their solution outside of their existing services in
          order to establish financial self-sustainability.

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
      Carriers that Care is a proposal for a senior check-in service to be
      delivered by mail carriers. This case study divides the service into three
      parts - pre-visit & sign-up, letter carrier visits, and post-visit updates
      - and talks through each touchpoint that occurs throughout.

    <h2>Scoping</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        The solution is made in consideration to the "Four Essential Pillars for
        Supporting Ageing in the Right Place", authored by the Canadian National
        Institute of Aging, with a particular focus on pillar 4 - improving
        social connections to reduce loneliness & social isolation.

    <p>
      This decision was made from my team and I's awareness that the idea of
      'caring for seniors' is accompanied by nuanced implications of medical
      care and invasion of privacy. We agree with this notion, and the idea that
      a service like Carriers That Care could unfairly put letter carriers in a
      position of authority without the proper training for it, thus putting
      seniors in a vulnerable position.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="grid-twocol">
    <div></div>
    <p>
      Our intention with introducing this framework is to ensure that we
      properly establish that we are designing around a domain within senior
      support that postal workers can reasonably intervene with, without
      reducing credibility or trust in Carriers that Care.

      <h3>Defining the service</h3>
      <p>
        A web portal, accessible from Canada Post's pre-existing website, would
        describe the details of Carriers That Care, allowing for a shared
        understanding of the service between families and seniors. To ensure
        that contents of this website are also available offline, we have
        designed a brochure to be mailed to indicate from one party to the other
        their interest in the service.
      </p>
      <img src="/Landing Page Scrollthrough.gif" />
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>Setting expectations & Consent</h3>
      <p>
        The sign-up process places emphasis on ensuring that the senior, who
        will be the recipient of the service, is aware of Carriers that Care and
        is consenting to receiving the service. Anticipating cases where
        families will be signing up on the senior's behalf, we have included
        callouts throughout the process, and will not begin delivery of the
        service until Canada Post receives vocal consent from the recipient.

      <h3>Equipping letter carriers with the right tools</h3>
      <p>
        To assist with effective check-ins, postal workers will be provided with
        an app that includes details about the people they are visiting, a form
        to report check-ins, and emergency contacts as well as resources to
        better equip them for unexpected situations. The check-in report is made
        to be as short-handed as possible to ensure that postal workers may fill
        them out while they are on the go.
