      <h3>THE FINANCIAL STATE OF CANADA POST</h3>
   
      <p>
        Canada Post has, for the last 17 years, been seeing a decline in their
        profits as letter delivery becomes increasingly replaced by the
        internet, while faster, cheaper competitors such as UPS and FedEx have
        been growing their shares in the parcel delivery market.
        <br /><br />
        On the other hand, they are in a unique position as a federal Crown corporation
        to deliver services to all communities across Canada. As underpinned in initiatives
        such as their introduction of ‚Äòcommunity hub‚Äô-style post offices, they are
        increasing efforts in serving rural areas as part of their solution outside
        of their existing services in order to establish financial self-sustainability.
      </p>
 

      <h3>THE POTENTIAL OF POSTAL WORKERS IN SENIOR CARE</h3>

      <div style="background-color: #FAFAFA; border: 1px dashed #333;">
        <p>
          "The definition of ‚Äúpostal work‚Äù has been expanding. In some places,
          French postal workers now pick up prescriptions, return library books,
          and deliver flowers. Last year, only twenty eight per cent of La
          Poste‚Äôs revenue came from sending mail."
        </p>
        <p>
          - In France, Elder Care Comes with the Mail, ¬†Zoey Poll, The New
          Yorker
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Across the globe, successful examples of senior check-in services
        delivered by postal workers, including the ‚ÄúMimamori‚Äù program from Japan
        Post and the ‚ÄúVeiller sur mes parents‚Äù program from the French La Poste,
        already exist.
        <br /><br />
        Additionally, since 2016, the Canadian Union of Postal Workers has been advocating
        for Canada Post to leverage its unique positioning and network of over (12540
        + 28,400) letter carriers to establish a check-in service for seniors.
        <br /><br />
        Furthermore, the National Institute on Ageing (NIA), a research centre based
        at Toronto Metropolitan University, also advocates that Canada Post is in
        a unique position to deliver such a service. Citing a poll conducted by Leger
        conducted in 2015, they state that letter carriers are amongst the most trusted
        professions in Canada, with 87% of Canadians saying they trusted their mail
        carriers.
        <br /><br />Although the proposal was modelled from overseas solutions,
        there was definitely opportunity within Canada‚Äôs seniors as well, with
        Statistics Canada reporting that 1 in 4 Canadians will be over the age
        of 65 by 2030 (in comparison to 15.3% in 2013), and the NIA and Canadian
        Medical Association reporting that 96% of Canadians want to age at home
        for as long as possible.

      <h3>PROPERLY SCOPING WHAT A POSTAL WORKER CAN AND CANNOT DO</h3>
      <p>
        It is important to note that initial proposals of Carriers that Care
        were met with a lot of hesitation from user testers. Having conducted
        user interviews with seven individuals with ages ranging from 20s to
        50s, centering our questions around allowed us to sort concerns into
        four categories:
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
      <img
        style="border-style: none;"
        src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbiwj2oo8/image/upload/v1709585139/Group_47_etzxgi.svg"
      />
      <div class="grid-twocol">
        <div></div>
      <p>
        Across all seven interviewees, the tangible aspects of Carriers That
        Care was universally agreed with to be valuable. However, there was
        concern over the concept of relying on letter carriers to report on
        senior wellbeing - the idea of 'caring for seniors' is accompanied by
        nuanced implications of medical care and invasion of privacy, which
        would put seniors in a vulnerable position as letter carriers would be
        granted a position of authority without going through the proper
        training.
<br>
        Given our results, there was a need to properly define the domains in
        which a letter carrier would support within Carrier that Care. In order
        to accomplish this, we evaluated a framework by the NIA that defines
        four essential pillars that are crucial to supporting ageing comfortably
        at home.
      </p>

      <div>

        />
      </div>
      <div class="grid-twocol">
        <div></div>
      <p>
        Amongst the four pillars, we scoped our service and moved forwards with
        an focus on designing around improving social connections to reduce
        loneliness and social isolation, a domain that postal workers can
        reasonably intervene with without reducing the credibility or trust in
        Carriers That Care.

        Audience would familiarize themselves with our service through the
        landing page of the service. Here, we outline a description of the
        service.

        Ensuring that loved ones have consented to the service, Canada Post will
        ask for contact information of both the loved one and family.

        The final step of the sign-up process will involve the senior recipient
        of the service, with Canada Post reaching out through a phone call to
        ensure that seniors will be aware of the service. <strong

<div class="grid-twocol">
  <h2 id="consentprivacy">What about Consent and Privacy?</h2>
  <p>
    A primary issue we need to address is the potential invasiveness of the
    service. To counter this, we have taken various measures across the site to
    ensure families inform their loved ones of the service and gain their
    consent to sign up through callouts, physical information packages and the
    call after the signup.
