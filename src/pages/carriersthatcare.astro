      How might we utilize the existing infrastructure of Canada Post to support
      socially isolated seniors?

    <br />
    <p>
      Canada Post has, for the last 17 years, been seeing a decline in their
      profits as letter delivery becomes replaced by the internet, while faster,
      cheaper competitors such as UPS and FedEx have been growing their shares
      in the parcel delivery market.
      <br />
      <br />
      On the other hand, they are in a unique position as a federal Crown corporation
      to deliver services to all communities across Canada. As underpinned in initiatives
      such as their introduction of

      they are increasing efforts in serving rural areas as part of their solution
      outside of their existing services in order to establish financial self-sustainability.
      <br />

      Carriers that Care is an expansion on an idea proposed by the

      >
      as one way to expand Canada Post's offerings.

          Although the Carriers that Care service is to be conducted in-person,
          postal workers and customers would need resources to ensure trust in
          the service. I lead the identification of necessary digital

          The discovery process of Carriers that Care includes a landing page

          such as options to mail brochures to loved ones as a means for a

        <p>
          Anticipating cases where families will be signing up their senior
          parents without warning, we have included callouts throughout the
          process, and will not begin delivery of the service until Canada Post
          receives vocal consent from the recipient. The progress of this
          consent process will be visible through the dedicated Carriers that
          Care dashboard, which will be accessible through the web portal or
          through logging into Canada Post's website.

        <h4>An app for postal workers</h4>
        <p>
          Once committed to the service, a postal worker will be assigned to
          conduct routine visits to the recipient's home. To simplify the
          service process for letter carriers, and to make the service less
          dependent on the carrier's individual ability to report on seniors,
          the reporting process will be conducted through mobile devices on the
          carrier.
        </p>

        <h4>Avoiding medical advice</h4>
        <p>
          Most letter carriers will not have undergone the necessary training to
          be able to make observations pertaining to medical conditions. To
          ensure that this services would be focused on social aspects, carriers
          would only be able to report objective data through the app (ie.
          whether or not a senior has new bruises). Additionally, Canada Post
          would not be allowed to suggest actions.

        <p>
          Each time a report is sent out by the letter carrier, both the

          view them through their preferred medium or text or email. This will
          be a preview edition, containing a brief description from the carrier
          of how the visitation went.

        <p>
          The dashboard will provide access to full reports once letter carriers
          start sending reports. At any point in the service, customers will
          also be able to fine-tune the service to their comfort with the
          ability to adjust visitation plans, collect more information about
          their assigned letter carrier, or submit feedback to the service.

        <!-- <img src="/Frame 10.png" style="width:70%;" /> -->

        <p>
          We also see the dashboard as an opportunity for Canada Post to connect
          Carriers That Care to other services in their ecosystem. One such
          proposal we had was the ability to have gifts hand-delivered by
          trusted posties through connecting our service to Canada Shops, an
          e-commerce store that was piloting during Fall of 2023.

        in contact, sometimes, there were events that senior parents would not
        think to communicate as they did not think of them as significant.

      <h2 class="headline-h2">Finding a starting point</h2>

      <p>
        Following our proposal, my team and I kicked off our process with a
        4-day design sprint, with the goal of identifying how we could best
        translate the exisiting check-in models of Japan Post and La Poste
        (France) to a Canadian context. At this point in our design process, all
        team members saw different ways Carriers that Care could fail, so I
        found that a sprint helped greatly pooling our thoughts to illustrate a
        shared understanding of what each of us thought were most actionable
        problem space in the service.

        Notably, our golden path exercise (pictured above) helped the team and I
        brainstorm several 'HMW' statements to use as starting points for our
        design project. Statements we created ranged from logisitical ('HMW fit
        this into a postie's day-to-day?') to aspirational ('HMW ensure this
        service doesn't become box-checking?') - ultimately, we settled on a
        statement that helped us set the focus of the service towards
        establishing trust and connections between service and customer.

        As a result of the golden path exercise, we created a landing page to
        communicate the values of the service and to establish trust amongst
        potential customers. We conducted a total of seven 30-40 minute user
        tests with people who lived independently from their parents. These
        candidates were from a varied age range between 20s to 50s. We then
        presented these to 7 users for feedback. This gave us insight into
        primary concerns that we should be addressing with our service.

        During user testing and in-class presentations, proposals for Carriers

        position where they would have authority in areas that they would not be
        adequately trained for - especially medical care.

        Focusing the service on social isolation & loneliness

      <p>
        Following user interviews, we conducted further research into "aging at
        home", hoping to find an area that postal workers could comfortably
        intervene in.
      </p>
      <h4>Four fundamental pillars for enabling "Aging in the Right Place"</h4>
      <p>
        Secondary research sourced from the <a
          href="https://www.niageing.ca/"
          target="_blank">National Institute of Ageing (NIA)</a
        > - particularly, their <a
          href="https://www.niageing.ca/airp"
          target="_blank">"Ageing in the Right Place" report</a
        >, defines four fundamental pillars that are essential in enabling older
        adults to age in the most appropriate setting where their personal
        preferences, circumstances, and care needs are met.

        <br /><br />
        This framework helped my team and I scope down our service focus to the fourth
        pillar,
        <strong
          >improving social connections to reduce loneliness and social
          isolation</strong
        >. I felt that this focus would be essential in keeping the trust of
        Carriers that Care, as I feel that postal workers would not have the
        capacity to reasonably support the other three pillars without
        fundamental changes to their jobs.

      This decision was made from my team and I's awareness that the idea of
      'caring for seniors' is accompanied by nuanced implications of medical
      care and invasion of privacy. We agree with this notion, and the idea that
      a service like Carriers That Care could unfairly put letter carriers in a
      position of authority without the proper training for it, thus putting
      seniors in a vulnerable position.

      <p style="color: black;">
        With the rise of digital alternatives, revenue from letter delivery has
        been on the decline for the past 17 years, and in parcel delivery,
        Canada Post been losing market share to faster, cheaper competitors such
        as FedEx or UPS. Utilizing their reach to approximately 17 million
        addresses across the country (Canada Post, 2021), Carriers that Care
        would introduce a new stream of revenue to the business.

      <br /><br />
      <h4 class="headline-h2">For the customer</h4>
      <p style="color: black;">
        The Canadian National Institute of Aging suggests "Improving Social
        Connections to Reduce Loneliness and Social Isolation" as one of its
        recommendations for better enabling aging at home. Carriers that Care
        provides opportunity to foster consistent social engagement by providing
        a means for seniors to maintain relationships and social connections.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- <p>

  While we acknowledge that implementation of this service alone would not
  resolve Canada Post's declining revenues, my team and I still believe that it
  would benefit the business in the way of opening new avenues for income. In
  Jersey, their check-in service is funded by their Department of Health and
  Community Services. Furthermore, in cases such as with the U.K’s Royal Mail
  Health, where customers may connect to a pharmacist or GP and have
  prescriptions delivered to their door, expansion of services has allowed for
  partnerships with large-scale pharmaceutical companies. Partnerships with
  government and other corporations are just a few ways that Canada Post could
  leverage Carriers That Care as a revenue source.
