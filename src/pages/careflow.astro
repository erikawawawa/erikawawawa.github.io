    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      CareFlow is a patient-monitoring platform currently in devlopment as part
      of the Continuous Connected Patient Care project, intended to assist
      clincians with at-home monitoring of COPD out-patients by providing a
      home-monitioring equipment kit. CareFlow's specific role was to not only
      normalize incoming data, but to provide a timeline visualizer that would
      allow nurses and clinicians to monitor patient data which would include
      vitals, medicine intake, pain score, and others. Additionally, clinicians
      working on quality improvement projects would be able to flag, and leave
      notes on data points for further review.
      <!-- CareFlow also  -->

    companies, and displays them in two segments: Insights Dashboard, and

    <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Being involved in this project from it conceptualization stage, my
        primary responsibilites evolved as the project progressed. They were as
        follows:
      </p>
      <h3>Product feature requirements, user flow development</h3>
      <p>
        Working with our project manager, I assisted in dissecting user
        interview answers from clinicians to identify key features of CareFlow.
        These would be documented to ensure that development and product teams
        were aligned on end goals for the platforms.
      </p>
      <h3>Interface design</h3>
      <p>
        My involvement in interface design included initial wireframing, to
        fine-tuning of colour palettes according to clinician input. Perhaps
        most notably, I would fine-tune medicine labels to match the colours of
        syringes used in anasethetics labs to better assist identification for
        clinicians.
      </p>
      <h3>Product demos, stakeholder interviews</h3>
      <p>
        In refining the specifics of each key feature, conducting secondary
        research on industry standards for medical data visualization could only
        carry us so far. My supervisor and I conducted weekly interviews with
        our cheif medical officer, an anaesthesiologist at Surrey Memorial
        hospital, in order to verify that our interface designs were being
        driven by accurate data about clinical industry standards.
      </p>

  <!-- <h3>Product demos</h3>


  <p>

  </p> -->
  <!-- <p>
    My main role was to collaborate with a clinical advisor, the development
    team and my design team lead to iterate on the timeline and dashboard
    designs.
  </p> -->

  <!-- <h2>Insights dashboard</h2>
  <p>
    Aggregates data from several patients and provides graphs and charts
    displaying trends amongst patients in hospital care, ie. comparisons of
    types of opioids used in hospitals.
  </p>

  <h2>Timeline</h2>
  <p>
    Intended for clinicians seeking to quickly gather information on a patient‚Äôs
    health journey, shows data visualization in the form of a timeline of a
    selected patient‚Äôs encounters with their local healthcare system; can
    highlight events of interest to compile as a patient consults report.
